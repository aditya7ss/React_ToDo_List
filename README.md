# React-TodoList
 create a react JS projects prototype that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks they want to work on. In addition, we want to mark those tasks as completed without deleting them. You will have to know how to define the basic structure and styling for your App components to specify individual components and learn how they interact.

From the end user's point of view, a user story represents a target that can be achieved. The app may be able to perform the following functions: add, mark as completed, delete, edit, and view specific subsets of tasks.
The context API will enable you to build your own hooks to hook into the context state of your app. You need to use react hooks for creating a Todo application.
